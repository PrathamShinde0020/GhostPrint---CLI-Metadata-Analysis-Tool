üëª GhostPrint üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A Command-Line Metadata Extraction Tool for Cybersecurity, Forensics & OSINT
Reveal the invisible. Extract the undeniable.
</div>

GhostPrint is a powerful, user-friendly CLI tool built in Python for extracting and analyzing hidden metadata from various file types. It is tailored for cybersecurity analysts, digital forensic investigators, and OSINT practitioners who need to quickly uncover digital traces left behind in files.

This tool can reveal critical insights such as file authorship, device details, software versions, timestamps, and even GPS locations, supporting investigations, detecting content manipulation, and aiding in threat actor reconnaissance.

‚ú® Key Features
1. üñ•Ô∏è Rich CLI Interface: Utilizes the rich library to provide a clean, colorful, and highly readable user experience with styled tables and interactive prompts.

2. ‚öôÔ∏è Dual-Analysis Engine: Employs a hybrid approach, using native Python libraries (Pillow, PyPDF2) for quick, human-readable summaries and integrating the industry-standard exiftool for comprehensive, deep-dive forensic analysis.

3. üõ°Ô∏è OSINT Risk Assessment: Automatically analyzes and flags high-risk metadata, providing instant context on potential data leaks (e.g., "Could reveal location," "Device fingerprint").

4. üìÇ Multi-Format Support: Natively parses metadata from common image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.) and PDF documents, with fallback support for dozens of other file types via exiftool.

5. üíæ Flexible Export Options: Allows users to export the extracted metadata to structured formats like JSON or CSV for further analysis, reporting, or integration with other tools.

6. üì¶ Standalone Executable: Packaged with PyInstaller into a single .exe file, allowing it to run on any Windows system without requiring Python or any dependencies to be installed.
